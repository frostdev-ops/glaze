# Development

How Glaze is put together, and how to build, test, package and publish it. See also [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md), [Releasing](../RELEASING.md) and [Firefox for Android testing](firefox-android.md).

## How it works

The content script adds three stylesheets it owns (`theme.css`, `motion.css`, `extras.css`) at page
start, so the popup can switch the theme on and off without a reload. `theme.css` remaps Blackboard's
own `--palette-*` custom properties onto Glaze's `--gz-*` tokens and restyles Ultra's components. Every
setting becomes either a `--gz-*` variable or a `data-gz-*` attribute on `<html>`, which the content
script writes from your saved settings, so the CSS never needs JavaScript to decide anything. A small
DOM sweep tags the long tail — hardcoded light backgrounds, dark text, viewport-fixed bars — with
`data-gz-*` attributes the stylesheets then restyle.

Each LMS loads only what it needs at first paint: the shared `content.js` (with the small libraries it uses)
plus that site's own part, `content-ultra.js` on Blackboard Ultra and `content-canvas.js` on Canvas. Moodle
has no part; it is themed by `content.js` and `moodle.css`. Everything else, from the command palette to the
grade calculators, loads on demand from `features/` the first time a page needs it.

## Building

```sh
./package.sh
```

Writes `dist/glaze-v<version>.zip`, ready for the Chrome Web Store. Requires `node` and `zip`.
`sh scripts/package-firefox.sh` writes it too, plus `dist/glaze-v<version>-firefox.zip` for Firefox Add-ons.
For a release, `sh scripts/release.sh` builds everything into `release/<version>/`; see [RELEASING.md](../RELEASING.md).

```sh
node --test
```

Runs the tests for the colour, settings and page-text logic. No dependencies to install.

### Publishing to the Chrome Web Store

```sh
sh scripts/publish-chrome.sh
```

Packages the extension, uploads it with the Chrome Web Store API, and submits it for review. Pass a
zip path to upload a specific build; set `CWS_NO_PUBLISH=1` to upload without submitting. It signs in
as the `cws-publisher` service account through `gcloud` impersonation, so no key file is kept: your
Google account needs the Service Account Token Creator role on it, and the service account must be
added under **Account** in the Developer Dashboard. The listing text, screenshots and privacy answers
aren't in the API; edit those in the dashboard. The publisher and item IDs default to Glaze's; override them with `CWS_PUBLISHER_ID` and `CWS_EXTENSION_ID` (the publisher ID is in the dashboard's address, after `/devconsole/`).

## Safari

Safari loads Glaze from this Mac app. The Xcode project is in `safari/`; to build the app yourself
you need Xcode and the public key from [Mac update release setup](#mac-update-release-setup):

```sh
sh scripts/build-safari.sh
```

That packages the extension, copies it into a temporary copy of the project, and builds a universal
app in `release/<version>/build/Glaze.app`, signed with the configured Developer ID. Override `SAFARI_SIGN_IDENTITY`
and `SAFARI_TEAM_ID` to use a different identity. Safari only installs apps from outside the App Store
when they are notarized, so pass a saved `notarytool` Keychain profile:

```sh
NOTARY_PROFILE=your-profile sh scripts/build-safari.sh
```

or set `ASC_KEY_PATH`, `ASC_KEY_ID` and `ASC_ISSUER_ID` for an App Store Connect API key. The script
then notarizes the app, staples the ticket, checks Gatekeeper, and writes
`release/<version>/github/glaze-<version>-safari-macos.zip` and a notarized `.dmg`, each with its SHA-256 checksum. Without credentials the zip is
marked `unnotarized` and is for development only.

For the Mac App Store, `scripts/appstore-safari.sh` archives the same project with App Store signing
and uploads the build to App Store Connect. It needs an App Store Connect API key with the Admin role in
`ASC_KEY_PATH`, `ASC_KEY_ID` and `ASC_ISSUER_ID`; Xcode creates the distribution certificate and profiles
on first use. `APPSTORE_EXPORT_ONLY=1` builds the signed package without uploading. Listing text,
screenshots and review submission happen in App Store Connect.

The app bundles only the files the Xcode project lists for its two extension targets (Mac and iOS); a folder
reference brings everything under it. Every build script copies the package into the project's Resources folder
and then runs `node scripts/safari-resources.js` on it, which stops the build if the package has a file the
project doesn't list. Add a new top-level file or folder to both extension targets in Xcode;
`test/safari-resources.test.js` checks the project against everything the package ships.

`scripts/package-safari.sh` regenerates the Xcode project from scratch and replaces its native edits.
Use it only when you mean to regenerate the project. It doesn't know about the iPhone and iPad targets below.

### Mac update release setup

The Developer ID build stages Sparkle 2.10.0 in a temporary Mac project through
`scripts/stage-safari-dmg.py`; the checked-in App Store project stays free of Sparkle.
Glaze's signing key was made once with the [Sparkle distribution's key generator](https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/#eddsa-ed25519-signatures)
(`bin/generate_keys`), which keeps the private key in the login Keychain (account `ed25519`) of the Mac
that made it. Back it up with `generate_keys -x <file>` and keep that file somewhere safe: without it,
no update can be signed for apps already installed. `scripts/build-safari.sh` passes the public key
(`0lbeC9MO1QDsjSGjs6iyxSBwXKMpEiKVoB+5wZwQEqY=`, or `SAFARI_UPDATE_PUBLIC_KEY` if set) into
`SUPublicEDKey` in the staged Mac app's `Glaze/Info.plist`. Staging on its own without a key leaves
updates disabled; a release build rejects the `REPLACE_WITH_SPARKLE_EDDSA_PUBLIC_KEY` placeholder.

After building and notarizing a release, generate its signed update entry locally (replace
`<version>` with the manifest version):

```sh
sh scripts/safari-appcast.sh "release/<version>/github/glaze-<version>-safari-macos.dmg" /path/to/Sparkle/bin
```

The helper verifies the notarized DMG and app, checks that the Keychain signing key matches the
app's public key, and writes `release/appcast.xml`, preserving older entries. It does not publish
anything. Upload the DMG to its GitHub release before publishing that feed at
`https://frostdev.io/projects/glaze/appcast.xml` (the frostdev.io path is `/projects/glaze/appcast.xml`).
Use the same Sparkle Keychain account for key generation and appcast signing; if you choose a
custom account, set `SAFARI_UPDATE_KEY_ACCOUNT` to it when running the helper.

### iPhone and iPad

The iOS app is two more targets in the same Xcode project (`Glaze iOS` and `Glaze iOS Extension`), sharing
the extension's resources and native handler with the Mac targets. `scripts/appstore-ios.sh` archives it
with App Store signing into `release/<version>/build/Glaze-iOS.xcarchive` and `release/<version>/app-store/glaze-<version>-ios.ipa`. It uses
the App Store profiles already on the Mac; set `ASC_KEY_PATH`, `ASC_KEY_ID` and `ASC_ISSUER_ID` to let Xcode
create them. It never uploads unless `APPSTORE_UPLOAD=1` is set. To try it in the Simulator, run the
`Glaze iOS` scheme in Xcode.
